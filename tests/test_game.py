"""
End-to-end tests for "For Real Life!".

Runs against any base URL, so the same suite covers the local server and the
deployed site:

    python -m pytest tests -q                                # localhost:3000
    python -m pytest tests -q --base-url=https://<live-url>  # post-deploy check

Every chapter is actually played to the finish line by fast-forwarding the
engine, which is the only way to be sure the level generator, the collectibles
and the results screen all still work.

The tests share one page per viewport and **run in file order**: the game is a
sequence (play a chapter, it unlocks the next, progress is saved), so the state
each test needs is what the ones above it left behind. Keep new tests in the
place their state belongs.
